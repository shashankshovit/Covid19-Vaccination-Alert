# Vaccine Availability Notifier Tool
When vaccines are in high demand in India, most vaccination centers have all slots booked.
This tool helps you and notifies you as soon as the vaccine becomes available at a center.
You can track multiple pincodes and apply age or vaccine filters.
This tool checks for all given pincodes (with filters) every 5 minutes and plays an alert sound as soon as it finds a vaccination center matching your search criteria.

## History
As the notification for 18+ was announced, I started checking Cowin site manually for availability of vaccine. I got tired and started looking for alternatives. I came across various tools which could notify me on email.

Now, first, email notifier service isn't reliable as the email might fire on delayed basis. Adding to this, I don't keep checking emails continuously. Hence I could lose all the slots till I see an email.

Hence, I built a very basic tool for myself which ran for 3 days continuously till the time it alerted me about the availability of vaccine in my region on 13th of May and I booked the first slot for 14th of May.

I helped a few of my friends using the same tool.

Now I have extended this tool with customizable filters like age and vaccine name. It plays an alert sound as soon as the required vaccine is available for the given pincode.

### Benefits
Instant alert and you can book your slot quickly.

### Limitations
Works best on laptop. Mobile OS kills the browser tab for battery optimization, and hence killing the script.


Sharing this tool on a broader scale in hope this can help someone else too.
