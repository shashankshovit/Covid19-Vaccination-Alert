# Vaccine Availability Notifier Tool

When vaccines are in high demand in India, most vaccination centers have all slots booked.
This tool helps you and notifies you as soon as the vaccine becomes available at a center.
You can track multiple pincodes and apply age or vaccine filters.
This tool checks for all given pincodes (with filters) every 5 minutes and plays an alert sound as soon as it finds a vaccination center matching your search criteria.
